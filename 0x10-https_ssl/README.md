[`1-world_wide_web`](...)|1. World wide web|Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain `www` points to your load-balancer IP (`lb-01`). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.
[`2-haproxy_ssl_termination`](...)|2. HAproxy SSL termination|Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www.
[`100-redirect_http_to_https`](...)|3. No loophole in your website traffic|A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
